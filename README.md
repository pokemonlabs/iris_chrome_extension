# Iris Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that integrates AI capabilities directly into your browser experience. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate that advanced AI capabilities can be seamlessly integrated directly into the Chrome browser without requiring external applications or services.

## üé≠ Use Cases

Iris Chrome Extension can enhance your browsing experience in numerous ways. Here are some examples of what it can do:

### Professional Communication

These are just a few examples of how Iris can assist with your browsing tasks. The extension is designed to be versatile and can help with a wide range of web-based activities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Click Handlers:** Browser interactions like clicking elements may be inconsistent. As a workaround, you can use [keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) for more reliable navigation.

- **Browser Compatibility:** Currently optimized for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.

- **Extension Sandbox Limitations:**
  - Limited access to certain browser APIs due to Chrome's extension sandbox security model
  - Cannot access privileged browser pages (chrome:// URLs)
  - Cross-origin restrictions limit interactions with iframes from different domains
  - Content scripts have restricted access to the webpage's JavaScript environment
  - Local file access is restricted for security reasons
  - API rate limits may affect performance with rapid or complex interactions

## ‚ú® Features

- AI-powered browser assistance via sidepanel
- Webpage interaction capabilities
- Screenshot and visual analysis
- Navigation controls for browsing assistance
- Contextual understanding of web content


## üöÄ Quick Start

To get started with the Iris Chrome Extension, you can bring your own API keys for AI model access or use OpenRouter to access a variety of models. This extension has been tested with Google Gemma 27B and Nova ACT, both of which perform exceptionally well with the extension's features. This flexibility allows you to tailor the extension's capabilities to your specific needs.

Additionally, the extension requires access to a coordinate mapping server that generates the layout of elements on the screen. We provide our own servers for this purpose, which are the same servers we use for our computer use agents. You can obtain your API keys and access our servers at [https://api.tryiris.dev](https://api.pokemonlabs.com).

All configuration options, including API key management and model selection, can be accessed through the extension's settings tab. Simply click on the extension icon and navigate to the settings to customize your experience.

For more reliable navigation when click handlers aren't working:

- **Tab**: Move focus to the next clickable element
- **Enter**: Click the focused element
- **Escape**: Cancel current operation

## üîç Our Focus

This extension serves as a proof-of-concept that advanced AI capabilities can be delivered directly through a browser extension, providing a seamless user experience without requiring external tools. By integrating AI directly into Chrome, we're demonstrating the potential for browser-native AI assistants that can understand and interact with web content in sophisticated ways.

While this browser extension is a significant step forward, our main focus continues to be on developing even more capable computer use agents that can perform complex tasks across entire operating systems. These agents are designed to understand and interact with computer interfaces in a more comprehensive way.
