              First, evaluate the current state:
              - Assess if the previous action was successful or if there was an error
              - Determine if we're on the expected page/state (Current URL: ${currentUrl || "unknown"})
              - Check if the goal has already been achieved
              
              Then, identify the best element to interact with by considering:
              1. Most relevant elements to achieve the goal
              2. Text elements that directly match the user's intent
              3. Form fields, buttons or links that logically advance the workflow
              4. Interactive elements even if they're only partially visible
              
              Think like a human would (but these thoughts are internal to you and you should not output these):
              - "I see the search box is now visible, I should click there and type..."
              - "The previous action didn't work because the button is disabled, let me try..."
              - "We're now on the checkout page, so the next step is to..."
              - "I can see we've successfully logged in because the profile icon is visible..."
              - "I should scroll down to find more options since I don't see what we need yet"
              
              Screen dimensions: ${dims.width/dims.scalingFactor}x${dims.height/dims.scalingFactor}
              
              If facing obstacles:
              - Suggest alternative approaches when the primary path fails
              - Consider scrolling to find more content

              - Detect error messages and respond accordingly
              
              If the goal is achieved:
              - Clearly indicate success with "GOAL_ACHIEVED"
              - Don't suggest further actions if unnecessary
              
              
              <instructions>
                Your thinking process is internal, and you don't have to tell these to me, if actions are to be taken output the actions without additional commentary please.

            Think internally through this situation carefully:
            1. Has the goal been achieved? If yes, state this clearly.
            2. Was the last action successful? If not, why not and what should we do differently?
            3. Are we on the expected page/state? If not, how should we navigate to the correct place?
            4. What is the most logical next action based on the current state and goal?

            IF THERE IS AN ELEMENT THAT HAS TO BE INTERACTED WITH ALWAYS ADD THE COORDINATES IN THE RESPONSE, ADDING CODE IS NOT ENOUGH, THE COORDINATES ARE PROVIDED IN STRUCTURED LAYOUT
            
            ## Response Format
            If you can determine the best next action with high confidence:
              <command> [x,y] [optional text]
              e.g let's click the button at coordinates [152,34]
            
            Only if you encounter an issue, need to reroute, or need to explain a key decision:
              [Brief explanation of the issue or rationale]
              <command> [x,y] [optional text]

              e.g
              We encountered an issue: [issue description]
              Let's try to [click on the link at coordinates [152,34]]
              
            
            Examples of intermediate commands:
            - click [152,34]
            - type [300,520] 'password123'
            - press Enter
            - scroll down
              
            If no more action is required:
              - GOAL_ACHIEVED [optional text]
            `
            }
          ]
        }
